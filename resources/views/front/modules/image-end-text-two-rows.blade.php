                    A Few Words About Me
                </h3>
                <p>
                    My name is Samantha Porter and Iâ€™m a psychologist and a cognitive behavioral therapist who has
                    worked with hundreds of patients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My work revolves around being friendly, disciplined, and organized yet flexible. I help my patients
                    resolve their emotional issues of the past and the present, to open the door to a brighter and
                    confident future.
