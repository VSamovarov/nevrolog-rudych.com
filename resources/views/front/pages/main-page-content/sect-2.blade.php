          A Few Words About Me
      </h3>
      <p>
          My name is Samantha Porter and Iâ€™m a psychologist and a cognitive behavioral therapist who has
          worked with hundreds of patients.
      </p>
      <p>
          My work revolves around being friendly, disciplined, and organized yet flexible. I help my patients
          resolve their emotional issues of the past and the present, to open the door to a brighter and
          confident future.
